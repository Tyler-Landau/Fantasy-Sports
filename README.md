The point of this Android application is to showcase my teams ability to create a fully functioning application of the Fantasy Sports genre. This application will allow the user to create or join a public or private fantasy league, with or without money, that will in turn allow other users to cooperatively play a sixteen week season. The game will include customizable parameters for each league, a draft system, trading system, points system with real-time updates, competitive play, and a championship round on the sixteenth week.

    ** Originally built to only allow Fantasy Football with no money and a simulated season off of .txt files due to being built off season.
    ** Plans to incorporate a real money system, Fantasy Soccer/Baseball/Basketball League options, college or professional teir, and real time updates off of player scores in
    real time games

Pseudocode
-

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
